- Wall of blocks
    - at least 10 high, 30 wide
        - enough to make it look fucking sweet
    - *"brick wall" pattern*
        - Hard requirement
    - Bricks are different solid colors
        - Draw lines on all bricks
    - wall rests on some flat ground
        - big 'ol box
    - HTML controls
        - Elevation (vertical angle), rotation (horizontal angle, Azimuth), Power of "launcher" via sliders
            - These 3 make up the initial force on our "shots"
            - small, non-colliding cube to show position
            - Space bar to shoot launcher
                - Should be able to hold down space with no slow-down
                    - "Recycle"
                    - Maybe start with a vector of 100 shots?
    - Recycle shapes when they fall off the platform
        - Remove them when they reach -Y = Z
